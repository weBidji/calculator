A web browser calculator made as an assignment from The Odin Project.

Retake on an older project I made, the goal this time being to write cleaner JavaScript logic and get rid of the ```eval()``` method previously used to perform calculations.

//// This is a WIP, I still need to add keyboard interactions (and possibly sound effects on button presses?) ////
